        <!-- Work Experience -->
        <div id="work">

            <h2>Work</h2>
            <p>I recently completed my internship at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hcss.com/">HCSS</a> where I was a UX Designer. I had the amazing opportunity to work alongside other experienced developers and designers and learn about the industry. I was also fortunate enough to work with another UX Designer intern on a large scale redesign of an iOS application. 
            <br>
            Together we carried out research into the users and the current application to find areas of improvement and figure what can be added to make it more useful.
            </p>

            <p>While pursuing my degree in Computer Science, I cofounded a startup called <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://twitter.com/shootwithshoot">Shoot</a>. Shoot was a platform for finding and booking
                the perfect photographer for your special moments. I was in charge of
                designing and building the landing page, and the first version of the platform, which was a very minimal version of a dula sided marketplace website. The entire website was created using just HTML and CSS and a few lightweight Javascript plugins. It was designed based on research our team conducted on our users and also tested with customers.

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>I have been doing most of my high and low fidelity prototypes in Figma. During my internship, I learned
                about:</p>

            <li>UX Research</li>
            <li>Interaction Design</li>
            <li>User-centered Design</li>
            <li>Rapid Prototyping</li>
            <li>Heuristic Analysis</li>
            <li>Design Thinking</li>
            <li>Design Systems</li>

            <p>I have done front-end web development using HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript. The styling for
                most of my projects were based off Bootstrap, as it gave me a proper foundation to build off of. A few
                of the school projects, which were team-based, were full-stack web development projects in PHP and
                MySQL.</p>
